hi
This is a JavaScript code written using React library and Recharts module to render a cryptocurrency chart. The chart shows the price changes of a selected cryptocurrency in a selected date range. The API used to fetch the data is the CoinGecko API. The code contains multiple states that store the data fetched from the API and update the chart accordingly, such as coinList, selectedCoin, chartData, chartType, and dateRange.

The code starts by importing React, useState, and useEffect from the React library, and LineChart, Line, CartesianGrid, XAxis, YAxis, ResponsiveContainer, Bar, BarChart, and Tooltip from the Recharts module, as well as the moment library for time formatting.

Then, the Chart function is defined and exported as a component. This function receives a vName prop that represents the value name of the selected cryptocurrency. Inside the function, the states are initialized using the useState hook, and two useEffect hooks are used to fetch the list of available cryptocurrencies and set the default selected cryptocurrency when the component mounts.

Next, another useEffect hook is used to fetch the price data of the selected cryptocurrency in the selected date range. The selectedCoin, dateRange, and vName values are used as dependencies to update the chart when the values change. The chart data is then processed using the map function to extract the date and price values and update the chartData state.

After that, three functions are defined to handle the change of the selected cryptocurrency, date range, and chart type. The selectedCoinName state is also set based on the selectedCoin value.

Finally, the return statement renders the chart and other components using conditional rendering based on the selected chart type. The LineChart component is used for the line chart, and the BarChart component is used for the
